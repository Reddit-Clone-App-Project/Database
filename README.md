### To write the code in sql from the desing in draw.io there are some precautions to keep in mind:
- User in Sql can't be used as a table name, so I changed the table name with **_app_user_**;
- Order in Sql can't be used as a table name, so I changed the table name with **_order_table_**;
- Sql transform all the word in lower case, unless you put " ", but you have to do it in all the file, so all the table from draw.io will change tha name for example from ProductVariant to product_variant;
